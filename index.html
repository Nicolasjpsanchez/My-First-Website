            <h3>History</h3>
            <p> Minas Anor, later known as Minas Tirith, was initially built in SA 3320 by the Dúnedain of Gondor as a fortress, 
                the "Tower of the Sun", to guard against the Men of the White Mountains. Serving as the home of Anárion, 
                while Minas Ithil housed Isildur, it became a central location in Gondor's history. After Sauron's 
                invasion in SA 3429 and subsequent wars, rule in Gondor shifted to Anárion's descendants. 
                King Ostoher transformed it into a city in TA 420, and over time, it surpassed Osgiliath in 
                importance, eventually becoming the capital in TA 1640. Following the capture of Minas Ithil 
                by Ringwraiths in TA 2002, it was renamed Minas Tirith, or "Tower of Guard". The last King of 
                Gondor, Eärnur, was slain soon after, leading to the Stewards taking over rulership. Significant 
                fortifications, including the Rammas Echor, were added around this period.</p>
            <h3>Minas Tirith in the Third Age</h3>
            <p>By the late Third Age, Gondor's power waned, marked by events like the death of the White 
                Tree in TA 2872 and the rebuilding of the White Tower by Ecthelion I. Despite strengthening 
                the city's defenses under Ecthelion II after Sauron's declaration in TA 2951, Minas Tirith 
                faced decline, with Aragorn (alias Thorongil) performing notable deeds there. During the
                War of the Ring in TA 3019, Minas Tirith was besieged by Mordor's armies, leading to the 
                significant Battle of the Pelennor Fields. The city prepared by repairing the Rammas Echor 
                and evacuating non-combatants. The battle saw the fall of Denethor II into despair, the 
                mortal wounding of King Théoden of Rohan by the Witch-king of Angmar, who was later 
                defeated by Éowyn. Aragorn's timely arrival with reinforcements from southern Gondor 
                turned the battle in favor of the Free Peoples, though the city suffered extensive 
                damage, including a broken Great Gate and devastation in its first circle.</p>

            <h3>Fourth Age</h3>
            <p>On May 1st, 3019, the Crowning of King Elessar (Aragorn) took place outside 
                Minas Tirith, marking his ascension as the King of Gondor and fulfilling 
                his destiny. This event also signified the re-founding of the Kings of 
                Gondor and, with Elessar's dual role as King of Arnor, established Minas 
                Tirith as the capital of the Reunited Kingdom. Post-coronation, Minas 
                Tirith underwent extensive repairs and enhancements under King 
                Elessar, with assistance from the Dwarves of Erebor, particularly 
                Gimli, who crafted a new gate, and the Elves led by Legolas, 
                who created new gardens. These efforts resulted in Minas Tirith 
                surpassing its original beauty, and the city remained strong and 
                rprosperous into the Fourth Age.</p>
