            Bree was an ancient settlement of Men in Eriador by the time 
            of the Third Age of Middle-earth, but after the collapse of
            the North-kingdom, Bree continued to thrive without any 
            central authority or government for many centuries. Bree 
            had become the most westerly settlement of Men in all 
            of Middle-earth by the time of the War of the Ring, 
            and became one of only three or four inhabited settlements 
            in all of Eriador. At the time of the War of the Ring, 
            Bree-land was the only part of Middle-earth where Men 
            and hobbits dwelt together. Being located on the most 
            important crossroads in the north, on the crossing of 
            the Great East Road and the Greenway, people would 
            pass through Bree. The Prancing Pony had many rooms, 
            but the local people did not seem accustomed to 
            many travellers.

            Hobbits from the Shire would also occasionally visit Bree. 
            The Rangers of the North were also familiar to Bree-folk, 
            though they were suspicious of them (and to them). Bree was 
            the place where, seemingly by accident, Gandalf and Thorin 
            II first met. They were both thinking about the same problem: 
            the dragon Smaug at the Lonely Mountain. The meeting led to 
            the undertaking of the Quest of Erebor, which resulted in 
            the death of Smaug and the finding of the One Ring 
            by Bilbo Baggins.

            Bree functioned as the capital of Bree-land, a small wooded 
            region near the intersection of the main north-south and 
            east-west routes through Eriador. In the years of the War 
            of the Ring, a day's ride east from the town along the 
            road lay the Forsaken Inn, according to Aragorn, although 
            nothing else is known of that place. Directly west of 
            Bree were the Barrow-downs and Old Forest.

            The name Bree means "hill" in Brythonic, a Celtic language,
            referring to the fact that the village of Bree and the 
            surrounding Bree-lands were centered around a large hill.
