            <h1>Info About Nazgûl</h1>
            <p>Nineteen Rings of Power were made in Eregion, forged 
                by Celebrimbor. These were locked away in one of the 
                safes of Eregion, but sixteen of them were captured 
                by Sauron. He gave nine of them to great lords and 
                warriors of Men, including three Númenóreans, and 
                one Easterling king. Sauron succeeded in corrupting 
                the powerful Nine through his dominance over the 
                rings. These Nine used the rings to achieve great 
                power, wealth, and prestige in life, but as time 
                passed the Rings continued to exert a corrupting 
                influence. The Rings eventually rendered their 
                bearers invisible to all but those who could 
                see into the wraith world, and enslaved them 
                to the will of Sauron. Their lives and their 
                powers became bound to Sauron's via the One 
                Ring; as Sauron grew or diminished, so too 
                did the Nazgûl.</p>

            <p>Three of the Ringwraiths may have been among the 
                first and most powerful Númenóreans to be corrupted 
                by Sauron, a thousand years before the Downfall: 
                they revered Sauron, and became ensnared in his 
                designs because of their lust for power or 
                knowledge. Only two of the Nine were ever named: 
                the Witch-king of Angmar and Khamûl the Easterling.
                The Nine were first observed around 2251 of the 
                Second Age, and soon became Sauron's primary 
                servants. Despite their great power and position 
                as instruments of Sauron's will, not much is known 
                of their activities during the Second Age. They 
                were temporarily dispersed after Sauron's downfall 
                in SA 3434 in the War of the Last Alliance. Though 
                no longer able to maintain physical form, just as 
                Sauron was after losing the One Ring, both the 
                Nazgûl and Sauron were able to endure as long 
                as the Ring survived.</p>

        <p>"Come not between the Nazgûl and his prey! 
            Or he will not slay thee in thy turn. He 
            will bear thee away to the houses of
