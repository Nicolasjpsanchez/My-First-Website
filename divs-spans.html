<h1>Edoras</h1>
    <h3>Edoras was the capital of Rohan. Built principally of wood, 
        and also where Rohan's kings were buried.</h3>

        <h3>History</h3>

        <p>Edoras was built on a hill in a valley of the White Mountains 
            by Rohan's second King, Brego son of Eorl the Young. Before 
            this, Rohan's capital was at Aldburg in the Folde. In Edoras' 
            center was the Golden Hall of Meduseld, where the ruler sat.</p>

        <p>In TA 2758, Edoras was overtaken by Dunlendings led by Wulf, 
            who ruled the city until the following year, when he was 
            slain and the Dunlendings driven out by Fréaláf Hildeson.</p>

        <p> It was at Edoras that Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas, and Gandalf 
            met with King Théoden in the year TA 3019, after the breaking 
            of the Fellowship of the Ring.[2] Whilst the Battle of the 
            Hornburg was being fought, a mustering of Rohan began at 
            Edoras, before it was moved to Dunharrow after Gandalf 
            spotted one of the Nazgûl flying near the settlement.</p>

        <p>Several months later, Elrond and Arwen parted for the 
        first time at Edoras, after a great feast in memory of Théoden.</p>

        

        <h3>Geography</h3>

        <p>Edoras was built at the end of the valley of Harrowdale, 
            which lay under the great mountain Starkhorn. The River 
            Snowbourn flowed past Edoras on its way west towards 
            the Entwash and was joined by a small stream with 
            its source near the top of the hill. As Rohan consisted 
            of mostly small villages and farmsteads, Edoras was 
            the largest settlement and held the Golden Hall of 
            Meduseld, the seat and residence of Rohan's kings. 
            The Barrowfield, where Rohan's kings were entombed, 
            lay outside the main gate.</p>
